# Textbook downloader for open source books provided by Springer

This application may be used to download textbooks from a PDF currently circulating 
  which has links to multiple books hosted by Springer. We aim to make it easier for the general public to avail of these facilities
   without having to manually download all the books. We have included the original PDF to ease the 
   search for the serial numbers for any particular book. Please input the serial numbers for any book you want, separated by spaces, and 
   these books will be downloaded to the folder from where the user ran this program. Please allow a minute or two for the books to begin downloading as it has to connect to
